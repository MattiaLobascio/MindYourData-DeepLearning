# MindYourData-DeepLearning

This repository is based on the assignments on Andrew Ng's machine learning MOOC on Coursera.

There are two branches. One with unsolved problems and the other with the same problems solved.

The intent is that new people to the machine learning and deep learning fields can try to solve this problems by themselves and with that get a better grasp of what happens within neural networks.
